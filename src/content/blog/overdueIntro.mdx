**My dog ate my laptop**

I've been busy, but then again who hasn't been? It has been over 12 years since I started on my journey to becoming an iOS developer, now I have been doing it professionally for 10 years. There was a lot to do and a lot to learn and I just didn't think to write any of it down as I went along.

Well, all that is changing now. I've had a lot of opportunities to solve interesting problems and have picked up some decent tips and tricks for building production-ready iOS apps and I now have a true desire to write and share in the hopes that it helps others, just like so many blogs have helped me over the years.

I will not commit to a schedule for publishing new posts, as I know that is a recipe for failure, all I can say is that now that the blog is up and running it will be much easier for me to start contributing to it as I stumble upon things that I find interesting while coding, or if I remember topics that I should have written about previously.

I called it **Progressively Informed** because that’s how I approach coding and life — always learning, rambling forward, and letting curiosity lead.
