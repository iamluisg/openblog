**My dog ate my laptop (there's photographic evidence, so it has to be real!)**

Ok, I don't have a dog (at least not yet) so it couldn't have eaten my laptop. The truth is that I've been busy, but then again who hasn't? Over 12 years have passed since I started learning iOS development, and i've spent the last 10 doing it professionally. With so much to learn and build I never stopped to write anything down along the way.

Well, all that is changing now. I've had a lot of opportunities to solve interesting problems and have picked up some decent tips and tricks for building production-ready iOS apps and I now have a true desire to write and share in the hopes that it helps others, just like so many blogs have helped me over the years.

I will not commit to a schedule for publishing new posts, as I know that is a recipe for failure, all I can say is that now that the blog is up and running it will be much easier for me to start contributing to it as I stumble upon things that I find interesting while coding, or if I remember topics that I should have written about previously.

I called it **Progressively Informed** because that’s how I approach coding and life — always learning, rambling forward, and letting curiosity lead.
