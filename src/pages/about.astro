			Hi, I'm Luis Garcia. I'm a software developer (mainly focused on iOS app development)
			passionate about building thoughtful, well-designed apps that solve real problems and sharing
			what I learn along the way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2015, I’ve developed and launched a wide range of iOS projects — from personal apps to
			large-scale applications for employers — gaining experience across the full development
			lifecycle. I’m also a co-founder of Oi Apps, an independent studio that has published three
			iPhone apps.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I’m not coding, I’m usually out walking, hunting for interesting books in old bookstores,
			practicing guitar or working on electronic music and sound installations.
		</p>
